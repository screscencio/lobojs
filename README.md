# 🐺 LoboJS

**Continuous, adaptive, and intelligent performance testing for developers.**

_Reborn from legacy. Powered by simplicity and insight._

## What is LoboJS?

LoboJS is a modern reimagination of the original **Lobo Continuous Tuning** — an open-source performance testing framework that reached over 40 countries nearly two decades ago.

Today, LoboJS is being rebuilt from the ground up, designed for:

- **Developers who want instant, code-level performance feedback**
- **Teams who need historical insights and intelligent thresholds**
- **Pipelines that demand performance as a first-class citizen**

Whether you're building an API, a complex algorithm, or a real-time system, LoboJS helps you stay fast — and stay smart.

## Why LoboJS?

✅ Familiar API (inspired by Jest and modern JS testing frameworks)  
✅ CLI integration for CI/CD pipelines  
✅ JSON export for historical tracking  
✅ Smart threshold logic (auto-adjusting performance baselines)  
🚧 Future: AI agents that detect regressions, suggest optimizations, and explain results.
